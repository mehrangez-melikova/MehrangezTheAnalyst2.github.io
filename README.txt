Problem: The initial movie dataset presented significant data quality challenges, including missing financial information (budget, gross revenue), inconsistent data types across crucial columns, and potential duplicate records. These issues hindered a reliable assessment of factors influencing box office success.

Action: As a Data Analyst, I executed a comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis pipeline using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Key steps included:

Data Cleansing: Identified and imputed missing values in budget (28%) and gross (2%) columns by filling them with zeros and converting them to appropriate integer types for accurate financial calculations.

Data Structuring: Created a standardized yearcorrect column from the released date string to ensure consistent temporal analysis. Duplicates were identified and removed to maintain data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed initial data inspections and sorted the dataset by gross revenue to observe top-performing films.

Correlation Analysis: Generated a correlation heatmap to visually identify and quantify the relationships between various movie attributes (e.g., budget, votes, company) and gross revenue.

Impact: This project transformed raw, inconsistent film data into a clean, robust, and analyzable dataset. The correlation analysis provided clear, data-driven insights, revealing which metrics significantly impact a film's gross earnings. This foundational understanding can inform strategic decisions for stakeholders in the film industry, enabling them to optimize resource allocation and enhance revenue potential.
